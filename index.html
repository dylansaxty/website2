    <h2> About Me</h2>
         <p> Dylan Saxty, born in 1997 in some field off of Labelle in a mobile home, I was brought into this world with nothing and I tend to leave it with everything. I believe my self to be an All-Around player to any team, I can always bring something new and refreshing to the table and engage with others to fully flesh out both their ideas and my own. Although not the smartest, I am not hopeless when facing new tasks and can easily adapt to it after fully analyzing the situation. Technology is my number one interest, if we were at the point in time where integrating a computer with your body was possible, I'd do it. </p>
        
         
         <p>As for hobbies I'm very much a homebody, If I'm not at work or school I'm most likely at my computer, playing games or watching compilations on YouTube. I was at one point a fluent Jazz Musician, second chair trumpet, but have since then let that go and have moved on to the piano and guitar. Progress on those two are a little sluggish at the moment. Besides winning soccer tournaments and getting awards from school, theres nothing I can look back at and be proud of myself for. My biggest goal is to become an expert in programming, C# at the moment, and create an app that revolutionizes the industry.   </p>
